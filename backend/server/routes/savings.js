// issue: when current_amount = goal_amount, stop adding to current amount. switch false to true. start a new goal and add the current_amount to the new goal.
// WHEN goal = current finished = true ?

// issue: when making a new goal, user enters current amount? or should it transfer over from the previous goal that was reached.
  // ie you had 100 left out of a 2000 goal, but your savings for that month was 500. how to get the extra 400 transfer to the new one?
  // post route -> current_amount


// add -> amount left?


// to do: remove savings prefix
